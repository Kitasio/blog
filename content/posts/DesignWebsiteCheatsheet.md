## 1. Gather information about the work,  ask the right questions


### 1. How Would You Describe Your Project?

Explain as expressively as possible the ultimate, "big picture" vision and purpose of your completed endeavor. How will it look, feel, taste, sound, perform, increase productivity, help your customers, or otherwise benefit humankind?

### 2. What Are Your Goals and Objectives?

What are you trying to accomplish? List the project goals and objectives in terms that are clear, concise, achievable, and measurable. Example: "Produce a four-hour video training series on self-defense with a training resource guide and database, to be accessible by college students on the Internet by May 2008."

Examples of audiences or beneficiaries include: Clients, customers, customers' customers, local communities, wildlife, students, and specific population segments.

Dribbble is a designer community that allows designers to upload their work. Web designers, graphic designers, illustrators, icon artists, typographers, and logo designers can use this site to display their work. You can look for various designs that can be your inspiration. I used to use Dribble if the design I was looking for was not found on Pinterest and to find references about UI design apps, web designs and other modern-themed designs.

### [3. Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/)

## 3. Start sketching

Use these tools to sketch only the required functionality, black and white style, no visual design in mind
