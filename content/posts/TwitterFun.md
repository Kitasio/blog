## The tweet

I studied abroad in Tokyo. In Japan, I discovered an ancient art of living. 10 ideas to find balance in life:

Wabi-Sabi – 侘寂 Life is beautiful not because it is perfect, but because it is not. Appreciate the simple things. There's beauty in everyday things if you're patient enough to look.

Ichi-go Ichi-e – 一期一会 Appreciate every second you share with others because you'll never have that exact same experience again. Treasure life moments. No moment in life can ever be recreated, so enjoy it at all costs.

Shouganai – しょうがな Maintain your dignity despite the inevitable challenges in life. It is what it is. Life requires us to appreciate its beauty and its burden.

Wa – 和 When members of a group fall into their natural order. Harmony (but deeper). A peaceful unity within a social group, putting community over self.

Shinrinyoku – 森林浴 If you spend time in nature, it will have healing benefits on your mental and physical health. Nature bathing. Take in the atmosphere and connect with nature through your senses.

Natsukashii – 懐かしい A fond memory of anything that takes you back to a moment in your past. More than nostalgia. A favorite childhood song, or trying something that tastes like your grandmother's recipe.

Yūgen – 幽玄 A mysterious sense of beauty in the universe. The subtle profundity of things. Beauty is not just about the seen, but the unseen.

Omotenashi – おもてなし Being thoughtful and considerate of others. Small, considerate acts. From an ancient ceremony—take painstaking care with each cup of tea.

Koi No Yokan – 恋の予感 The feeling when we meet a person we believe we'll inevitably fall in love with. Love at first sight (but deeper). A trust in the inevitability of love.

Mono no aware – 物の哀れ The appreciation we have for life is heightened by how short life is. Remember, life is short. We are lucky to experience the beauty and melancholy of everyday living.
