### CPU
In the core of modern computers we have the _central processing unit_,  if we crack it open we find a piece of silicon that contains _billions of tiny transistors_,  which are like __microscopic on off switches__ the value at one of these switches is called a __bit__

---
### Bit
bit for binary digit can be 0 or 1, usually comes at a package of 8 called __byte

---
### Byte
One byte can represent _256 different values_ like all the characters that you type on your keyboard, in fact when you type into your keyboard the character produced is actually mapped to a binary value in a character encoding like ascii or utf-8

_Character __'b'__ is mapped to __98__ and equal to **1 byte**, it can store up to 256 [read more about unicode and codepoints (Elixir docs)](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/binaries-strings-and-char-lists.html#unicode-and-code-points)

_Character __'ц'__ is mapped to __1094__ and takes to **2 bytes**, can store max of 65536

Rust's `i8` can store numbers from $-(2^7)$ to $2^7-1$, which equals -128 to 127. Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to $2^n - 1$, so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to $2^8 - 1$, which equals 0 to 255. [source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#data-types)

### Binary
Binary is just a _system for counting_ like the base 10 system you normally use when counting on your fingers, but it only has two characters _one and zero_, humans have a hard time reading binary so most often it's represented in a hexadecimal base 16 format

To convert from __binary to decimal:

![picture about binary](/binary.png)

This will be equal to 123

To convert from __decimal to binary:
1.  Increment the least significant number
2.  If least significant number exceeds maximum value, reset and increment the number one place left

```
// No bits set => zero
00000000 = 0
// Increment least significant bit
00000001 = 1
// Least significant bit exceeds max, so we reset it and increment bit left of it
00000010 = 2
00000011 = 3
00101010 = 42
11111111 = 255
```

### Hexadecimal base 16
`0123456789abcdf` 

Ten numbers and six letters can represent a four bit group called a _nibble
`1101 - D, 1110 - E, 1100 - C` 

---
### Ram - Random access memory
RAM is like a neighborhood, and inside of every house lives a byte, _every location has a memory address which the cpu can read and write to_ you can think of the cpu and ram as the brain of the computer

---
### Expression
Code that produces a value
`return a + b`

---
### Statement
Code that does something
`if a > b:`

---
### Big O
discussed more deeply here [[index]]

big-o notation it's a standard format for _approximating the performance of an algorithm at scale_, it may reference _time complexity_ which is __how fast your algorithm will run__ and _space complexity_ which deals with __how much memory is required to run it

### Stack and heap
The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This is referred to as _last in, first out_. Think of a stack of plates: when you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a plate, you take one off the top. _Adding or removing plates from the middle or bottom wouldn’t work as well!_ Adding data is called _pushing onto the stack_, and removing data is called _popping off the stack_. All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. __Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

The heap is less organized: _when you put data on the heap, you request a certain amount of space._ The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and _returns a pointer_, which is the address of that location. _This process is called allocating on the heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_ (pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and the staff finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to find you.

_Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap_ because the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; _that location is always at the top of the stack._ Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the allocator must first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.

Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables. It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the same token, _a processor can do its job better if it works on data that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away (as it can be on the heap).

_When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s local variables **get pushed onto the stack**. When the function is over, those **values get popped off the stack.**
